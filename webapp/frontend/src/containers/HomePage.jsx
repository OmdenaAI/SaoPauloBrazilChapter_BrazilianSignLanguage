        This is a demo app for an AI model developed to <b>translate Brazilian Sign Language from a healthcare context</b>. 
        <br />
        It was built during an <b>Omdena challenge with the SÃ£o Paulo chapter</b>.
        For more details about the project, please visit our <a href="https://omdenaai.github.io/SaoPauloBrazilChapter_BrazilianSignLanguage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Project Page website</b></a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The AI model was trained to recognize <b>25 different signs</b>.
        Below you can test it out on some sample videos from our dataset, or upload your own!
